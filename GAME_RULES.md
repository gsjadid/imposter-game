# Imposter - Game Rules & Mechanics

**Imposter** is a social deduction game where players must identify the hidden Imposter among them while the Imposter tries to blend in and survive.

## 🎭 Roles

At the start of the game, players are secretly assigned one of two roles:

### 1. **Civilian** (Majority)
*   **Knowledge:** Knows the **Secret Word** and the **Category Hint**.
*   **Goal:** Identify the Imposter and vote them out.
*   **Strategy:** Give clues that prove you know the word without making it too obvious for the Imposter to guess.

### 2. **Imposter** (1 Player)
*   **Knowledge:** **DOES NOT** know the Secret Word. Only sees the **Category Hint** (e.g., "Fruit").
*   **Goal:** Blend in, avoid suspicion, and survive the vote.
*   **Strategy:** Listen to other players' clues, deduce the word (or a related concept), and give a vague but plausible clue to avoid detection.

## 🕹️ Game Phases

### 1. **Lobby**
*   Players join the room using a room code.
*   The host starts the game once everyone is ready.

### 2. **Setup & Role Reveal**
*   Each player receives their role.
*   **Civilians** see the Secret Word (e.g., "Apple").
*   **Imposter** sees "???" but gets the Category Hint (e.g., "Fruit").
*   Players mark themselves as "Ready" to proceed.

### 3. **Clue Phase**
*   Players take turns giving a **one-word clue** related to the Secret Word.
*   *Example:* If the word is "Apple", clues might be "Red", "Pie", "Crunchy".
*   The Imposter must improvise a clue based on the category and previous clues.

### 4. **Discussion Phase**
*   **Duration:** 3 Minutes (or until Host forces a vote).
*   Players discuss the clues given.
*   Civilians analyze who gave a suspicious or off-topic clue.
*   The Imposter tries to deflect suspicion.
*   **Emergency Meeting:** The Host can end the discussion early to start voting immediately.

### 5. **Voting Phase**
*   Players vote for the person they suspect is the Imposter.
*   Players can also choose to **Skip Vote** if they are unsure.
*   Voting ends when all players have cast their vote.

### 6. **Resolution**
*   Votes are tallied.
*   The player with the most votes is ejected.
*   **Winning Conditions:**
    *   **Civilians Win:** If the ejected player is the **Imposter**.
    *   **Imposter Wins:** If a **Civilian** is ejected, or if the vote ends in a tie/skip (Imposter survives).

## 📝 Example Gameplay

**Secret Word:** *Sun*
**Category:** *Star*

*   **Player A (Civilian):** "Hot"
*   **Player B (Civilian):** "Yellow"
*   **Player C (Imposter):** "Bright" (Good bluff!)
*   **Player D (Civilian):** "Space"

*Discussion:* Player D might suspect Player C was too generic, but "Bright" fits. Player A is safe.
*Voting:* If they vote out Player C, Civilians win. If they vote out Player D, Imposter wins.
